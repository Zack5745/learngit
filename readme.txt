Git is a version control system.

use "vi" to create a file;
than use "cd"t o open the file;
use fg to recoveray the file that down
E means Edit anyway;
R means Recovor;

use i to edit;
to esc: use Esc input : ,wq(write quit)
enter;

to delete: put Esc, than put "x",  or "dd".

it is very complex ,right?
